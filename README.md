Core Features:

Aggregate comprehensive music data from open APIs like Spotify, MusicBrainz, and Genius including metadata on songs, artists, lyrics, genres, moods, and release dates.

Implement an embedding model to convert music features, lyrics, or descriptions into vector representations for semantic similarity comparison.

Provide a user-friendly web interface that allows users to perform semantic search queries such as “songs similar to X,” “uplifting tracks,” or “music with poetic lyrics,” enabling discovery beyond simple keywords.

Deliver search results with sub-second latency for a smooth user experience.

Display relationships or trends visually between tracks, artists, albums, or moods to aid exploration.

Expanded Context:
The platform’s NLP/embedding-powered search enables understanding of music content and connections through meaning and similarity rather than exact keyword matches, placing it beyond traditional music search functions. This leverages state-of-the-art music understanding and generative foundation models' principles that continue to transform music discovery and personalization technologies. Features inspired by successful existing platforms include AI-curated personalized flows, advanced filters by mood or genre, collaborative playlists, and social sharing for community engagement.
