# Mood - song searcher 🔎

Designed to allow a user to quickly search up a song, artist, or anything relavant in the search bar.

## Background 💡
Came across key words such as "embeddings" and "vector searches" where I discovered how much they can improve the capabilities of finding relavant and meaningful information in complex data. Therefore, I created this project to grasp the basic understanding on how to create embeddings on songs through the use of OpenAI and using Supabase functions to retrieve the songs for the search result.

## What I learned 🧠
- How to generate these embeddings from song metadata or user text inputs using OpenAI embeddings.
- Integrated Supabase's pgvector extension to enable searches in the song dataset.
- How to ingest songs to clean it up for my database. Currently, the database has about 1000 songs.
